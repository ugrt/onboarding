Ubuntu 16.04 is the recommend flavour which will be used to build/complie
projects.

## General purpose programming languages

Python is a easy language to us for protyping. C/C++ should be used only when
required to write drivers or tasks that require effective computations.

### Arduino
Arduino uses the C++ programming language and builds on top of it with its own
libraries. Make sure to familiarize yourself with C++ to a basic level before 
starting with Arduino.

## ROS
ROS (Robot Operating System) isn't really an operating system, but rather a 
framework for building and communicating with Robots. The core is written is
C++, but many modules are also available in Python 2.

Also note, ROS is currently only supported on Ubuntu 16.04 (last checked: 2018-09-10).
